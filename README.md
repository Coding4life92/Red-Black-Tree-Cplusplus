# Red-Black-Tree-Cplusplus
Redd-Black Tree Insertion in C++

Rules That Every Red-Black Tree Follows: 
Every node has a colour either red or black.
The root of the tree is always black.
There are no two adjacent red nodes (A red node cannot have a red parent or red child).
Every path from a node (including root) to any of its descendants NULL nodes has the same number of black nodes.
All leaf nodes are black nodes.
